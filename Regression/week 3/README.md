# Week 3 — Regression Assumptions & Diagnostics (California Housing)

## Goal
Validate the assumptions behind multiple linear regression using diagnostic plots and influence measures.
This week focuses on:
- Linearity
- Homoscedasticity
- Normality of residuals
- Independence (discussion)
- Outliers / influence (Cook’s distance)

Outcome: a short diagnostic report + an illustrative fix (transformation or outlier handling).
