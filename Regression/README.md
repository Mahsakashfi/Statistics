# Simple Linear Regression – Week 1
This project is a first step toward learning regression. It uses a small dataset of study hours and exam scores to build and analyze a simple linear regression model.

# **Goal** 
- Understand how one variable (Hours) affects another (Scores) and learn the basics of fitting and evaluating a regression model.
# **Steps Covered**
- Load and clean the dataset
- Explore the relationship with a scatter plot
- Fit a simple linear regression model
- Interpret slope and intercept
- Make predictions
- Plot the regression line and residuals
- Calculate R² manually and with sklearn
# **Dataset**
- Columns:
- Hours: number of hours studied
- Scores: exam score
- A clear, mostly linear relationship makes this dataset ideal for beginners.
# **Files**
- Week1_Regression.ipynb – main notebook
- student_scores.csv – data
# **Results (summary)**
- More study hours lead to higher predicted scores.
- Residuals are reasonably random → linear model fits well.
- R² shows the model explains a large portion of score variation.
